Homework # 6 a weather forecast

Just key in the city name & the weather for that day & that city will pop up. In the bottom in the blue are is the 5 day forecast for that city. Any city entered will also have a new button creted. This screen will also "remember" what you put in for the next time you use the app.

Problems with the app is that it will accept anything in city name & will do no validation.
